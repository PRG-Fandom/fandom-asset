A quick description of the files layout on the github repository.
(It may change in the futur).

## CSS
Where all the CSS files used on the Fandom are stored. They are import on fandom using the @import command.

For backup, a copy of the main files from Miraheze are also stored.


## Test
Folder to experiment and try different function and code. Everyone should have their own deposit since Git's pull ignore it.

## Prototype
Must be done, but later.
It contains the Gallery.
